# Best Practices

### File Names
```
File names should not have spaces in between words.
Use camel case, underscores, or dashes in between words

ex
starWarsPlanets.html
star-wars-planets.html
star_wars_planets.html

```

### index.html

```
You have to have an index.html file. 
Do not rename this file to home.html, main.html, or anything else
The servers look for an index.html file when loading web pages. It's standard.

```

### CSS
```
CSS files should be linked at the top of the html files
They should be kept in a css folder
Do not put your css inline unless you have a really good reason to do so

```

### JavaScript
```
Javascript files should be loaded at the end of the html files
The should be kept in a javascript or js folder
Do not put your javascript inline unless you have a really good reason to do so

```
